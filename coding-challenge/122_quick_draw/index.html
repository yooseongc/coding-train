            <h4>Quick Draw Project of Google</h4>
            <p><a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/">Quick Draw!</a> is a game built with machine learning. You draw, and a neural network tries to guess what you’re drawing. Of course, it doesn’t always work. But the more you
            play with it, the more it will learn. So far we have trained it on a few hundred concepts, and we hope to add more over
            time. This is a part of 'AI Experiments' of Google.</p>
            <p>You can get datasets from <a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset">this Github repo</a>.</p>
