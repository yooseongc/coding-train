/* 

    In geometry, the toothpick sequence is a sequence of 2-D patterns 
        which can be formed by repeatedly adding line segments ('toothpicks') to the previous pattern
        in the sequence.
    The first stage of the design is a single "toothpick", or line segment. 
    Each stage after the first is formed by taking the previous design and, 
        for every exposed toothpick end, placing another toothpick centered at a right angle on that end.

    This process results in a pattern of growth 
        in which the number of segments at stage n oscillates with a fractal pattern between 0.45*n^2 and 0.67*n^2.
    If T(n) denotes the number of segments at stage n, 
        then values of n for which T(n)/n^2 is near its maximum occur when n is near a power of two,
        while the values for which it is near its minimum occur near numbers that are approximately 1.43 times a power of two.
    The structure of stages in the toothpick sequence often resemble the T-square fractal, 
        or the arrangement of cells in the Ulamâ€“Warburton cellular automaton.
